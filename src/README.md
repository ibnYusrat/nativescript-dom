# Free version for `nativescript-dom` (renamed to `nativescript-dom-free`)

A rather maintained version of `nativescript-dom`. This is simply a fork of `nativescript-dom` which is no longer available without a subscription 
and is not guaranteed to work with NativeScript 6.x. This repo is my attempt towards keeping it usable enough for those who are not ready to buy a subscription yet.

To use this, simply install with NPM using:

`npm install nativescript-dom-free`


All credit goes to: <a href="https://github.com/NathanaelA">NathanaelA</a> for writing this. I am only attempting to maintain it without charging anything.
